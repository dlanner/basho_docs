Lists keys in a bucket.

<div class="note">
<div class="title">Not for production use</div>

This operation requires traversing all keys stored in the cluster and should not be used in production.

</div>

## Request

```bash
GET /riak/bucket?keys=true            # List all keys, old format
GET /buckets/bucket/keys?keys=true    # List all keys, new format
GET /riak/bucket?keys=stream          # Stream keys to the client, old format
GET /buckets/bucket/keys?keys=stream  # Stream keys to the client, new format
```

Required query parameters:

* `keys` - defaults to `false`. When set to `true` all keys will be returned in
a single payload.  When set to `stream`, keys will be returned in
chunked-encoding.

Optional query parameters (**only** relevant to requests sent using the old `/riak/` path)

* `props` - defaults to `true`, which will also return [[bucket properties|HTTP-Get-Bucket-Properties]] in the response. Set to `false` to suppress properties
in the response.

## Response

Normal response codes:

* `200 OK`

Important headers:

* `Content-Type` - `application/json`
* `Transfer-Encoding` - `chunked` when the `keys` query parameter is set to
`stream`.

The JSON object in the response will contain up to two entries,
`"props"` and `"keys"` which are present or missing according to the
query parameters and format used.  If `keys=stream` in the query
parameters, multiple JSON objects in chunked-encoding will be returned
containing `"keys"` entries.

## Example

```bash
$ curl -i http://localhost:8098/buckets/jsconf/keys?keys=true
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Server: MochiWeb/1.1 WebMachine/1.9.0 (participate in the frantic)
